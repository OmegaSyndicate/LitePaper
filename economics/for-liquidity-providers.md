The economics for liquidity providers consist of two parts: revenue and costs.

### The economics of providing liquidity <a href="#4475" id="4475"></a>

The interaction that liquidity providers have with DefiPlaza is providing liquidity to the exchange, which is then used to allow customers to swap tokens against. At any point in the future, the liquidity provider may decide to withdraw their liquidity back into their own wallets. The question at hand is how much they will get back when they do. To understand what drives profit or loss in a multi-token AMM, let’s look at all components that factor into the value difference when depositing versus when withdrawing.

1. **Income from fees**. The primary reason to provide liquidity to an AMM is that end-users can trade against the liquidity in the pool for a fee. The fee on each trade (or liquidity add) on DefiPlaza is 0.1% of the input tokens. These fees accumulate in the DEX and result in a steady appreciation of the XDP2 index token over time.
2. **Price change of the underlying tokens**. The DEX lists 16 tokens and for each of these tokens it holds a reserve. If the underlying tokens appreciate in value, so does the index token. If the underlying tokens depreciate in value, so does the index token.
3. **Impermanent loss**. When the exchange is in balance, the dollar value of each token reserve in the DEX is equal. Suppose that one token suddenly doubles in value. In that case the spot price on the DEX is no longer in balance with the external price, creating an arbitrage opportunity. After a while and a number of trades the exchange will once again be in balance and all 16 token reserves will be somewhat increased. However, the total value increase in XDP2 that this represents is not quite equal to the initial value increase of the single token which doubled in price. This difference is called impermanent loss and will be discussed in detail in the next section.

When the liquidity provider withdraws his liquidity, the amount they will get back is the original amount they put in, plus the fees accumulated over time, plus the price change of the underlying tokens, minus the impermanent loss. Thus, to make a profit on the trade as compared to simply keeping the same portfolio of 16 tokens it is required that the fee income outweighs the impermanent loss in the long run. Let’s look at these two components in more detail.

## Fee income in a multi-token AMM <a href="#39af" id="39af"></a>

Trading fees are generated by trades taking place against the liquidity held by the AMM. The fee is currently set to 0.1% of the value for every trade on the exchange. If there are more trading volume, there is more fee income. Arguably the most important performance metric for any AMM is the amount of fees generated per amount of liquidity in the AMM. As we saw in the previous article, more liquidity generates less slippage per trade, but at the same time more liquidity means less income per trade for the liquidity providers.

How much liquidity does an AMM actually need to be optimally competitive? Let’s consider the largest UniSwap v2 pool with a USD component (USDC/ETH) as an example. As of July 2021 (when I did this analysis) that had around 320 M$ in liquidity. With the same total liquidity, DefiPlaza would have about 20 M$ per token spread evenly over the 16 tokens. UniSwap uses a 0.3% trading fee. DefiPlaza uses a 0.1% trading fee, so break even in trading fee cost to the consumer happens when DefiPlaza has 0.2% more slippage than UniSwap on any given trade.

With 20 M$ liquidity per token, DefiPlaza reaches a slippage of 0.2% for a trade value of 40 k$. This means that for all trades with with values below 40 k$, DefiPlaza could provide a more competitive offering to the consumer than UniSwap _**regardless of how much liquidity UniSwap has for that pair**_. The lower the trade value, the less significant the slippage and the more attractive DefiPlaza will be versus UniSwap. So how many of those lower value trades are being done? Consider the trades for 100,000 consecutive blocks in July 2021 on the USDC/ETH pair, a dataset of ±108k trades. The data for these trades is plotted below:

The plot shows that >90% of the trades are below 40k USDC. Thus, DefiPlaza with the same 320M liquidity could outcompete UniSwap for 90% of the trades for the USDC/ETH pair, while also outcompeting UniSwap on 119 additional pairs for all trades <40k$ in size! That is the capital efficiency gain from pooling many assets together at work.

The fraction of trades where DefiPlaza outcompetes UniSwap would be very large at 90%, but what does that mean for fee income? In the graph below we see the cumulative fraction of fee income plotted against the trade size in the same period as discussed above. What we can see in this graph is that roughly 30% of the fees of this pool are generated by the 90% of trades that are smaller than 40 k$ in size. At the lower fee percentage, those trades represent an equivalent income for DefiPlaza LPs of roughly 10% of the USDC/ETH UniSwap pool fee revenue.

This means that in a transparent market DefiPlaza should be able to take 10% of the UniSwap v2 USDC/ETH trading fees at the same liquidity. If we then take into account the other 119 trading pairs that DefiPlaza offers with the same liquidity, the combined fee income should easily reach more than 100% of the UniSwap USDC/ETH liquidity provider income. The above comparison is only against the UniSwap v2 liquidity & volume, DefiPlaza should be able to take market share from other DEXes as well further increasing fee revenue.

All this makes that we believe DefiPlaza can offer liquidity providers a competitive revenue even at a 0.1% fee level once it gains traction.
